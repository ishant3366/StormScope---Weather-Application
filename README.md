OVERVIEW -: So I created this repo and imported it to vercel and deployed it but its not executing properly on vercel as the background, visuals , images , hovers and transitions have disappeared which is probably due to incorrect file paths which I am unable to identify so I am attaching a screenshot of what the web application looks like when it runs locally on my pc.
